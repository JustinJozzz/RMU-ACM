Make sure to have downloaded [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Open Visual Studio Code and go to File->Open Folder. Go to any directory and create a new folder.

Single Click this new folder and press 'Select Folder'.

Go to View->Integrated Terminal.

Type the command: git clone https://github.com/JustinJozzz/RMU-ACM.git
This will download the smu-acm repository.

At this point open up Week6, go to the StartingPoint folder and open the main.js file. Make the function in main.js that you were assigned to.
Make sure that you set the firebase url to 'https://acmchromeextension.firebaseio.com/faculty.json' or whatever other firebase you have.

Once you are done with this hit up Justin, if he is not talking to Dr. Al-Jaroodi.
