# Introduction
This week we will make the basic starting point of an API. We will use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the node package, [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

If you would like to clone this repositroy you will also need to download git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

NodeJS is the only dependency to run this program, but we will use Visual Studio Code as our editor and Postman to test our API.
